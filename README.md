# FooBar
Just playing around with the Git command line to learn the system.

Now I'm making changes to my working files from within ChromeOS, though I have to wait until I get to my PC before my backup sync of files makes its way to my PC, before I can then stage, commit and push.  Better than nother though - huh!  However, once I get a Chromebook that support Crostini, I'll be able to do all via Visual Studio Code and Git for Linux. :)

This was all my own doing, so proud. LOL
